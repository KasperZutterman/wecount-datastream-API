# Wecount datastream API

## Starting the express server
```npm run start```

## About
This is used to provide an API that maps the telraam "get all active cameras" & "daily traffic" to a linked data stream.

### Active cameras: 
endpoint: \cameras  
params:
- page

### Daily traffic:
endpoint: \cameras  
params:
- page
- date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

This endpoint uses the daily json files generated by the [wecount-daily-cron-job](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/wecount-daily-cron-job)

## TODO / optimalisations
- Convert hardcoded params and paths in a .properties file
- The [wecount-daily-cron-job](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/wecount-daily-cron-job) files folder should be the same as this files folder.
- Tweak the timeout intervals to not overload the telraam API.
- Maybe change the "tree:relation" to a more favorable pagination.
- Change the page-size?
- Handle wrong dates in request params
